# Community Contribution Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to our library! 🙌🏾

This document outlines everything you need to know about contributing.

**[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/probot/template/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**

## **I Have a Question, Not a Contribution**

If you have a question, please don’t open an issue. Instead, feel free to ask on our [forum](http://forum.flutterwave.com) or join our developer [Slack](https://bit.ly/34Vkzcg). Our team of engineers is ready to assist you.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting a Bug

Spotted a bug? Great! Before reporting it, please:

1. Search to see if another user has already reported the bug. If an issue exists and is still open, add a comment instead of creating a new one.
2. Check our forum and developer Slack to see if the issue has already been addressed.

When reporting an issue, please:

1. **Explain the Problem:**
   - Use a clear and descriptive title.
   - Provide detailed steps to replicate the bug, being as precise as possible.
   - Include screenshots of any error messages.
2. **Include Configuration and Setup Details:**
   - Specify the version of the library you are using.
   - Mention if the bug occurred in test mode or live.
   - Confirm whether you have the recommended versions of the library dependencies.

> 💡 Please use the issue template when reporting bugs.

### Requesting a Feature

If you would like to request a new feature, please email us at developers@flutterwavego.com. Be sure to include:

1. A clear title for the requested feature.
2. A brief description of the use case.
3. An explanation of how this feature would enhance your integration.
4. The library name and version you are using.

### Submitting Changes (Pull Requests)

You can contribute by making any of the following changes:

1. Bug fixes
2. Performance improvements
3. Documentation updates
4. Functionality changes (new features)

> 💡 Changes that are purely cosmetic and do not add significant value to the stability, functionality, or testability of the library will generally not be accepted.

When submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add tests for any changes you make, excluding documentation updates.
3. If you are adding a new feature, update the documentation to show how to use it.
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Run linting to ensure your code adheres to style guidelines.
6. Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use one-liners for small changes, but provide more detail for larger changes (see example below).
7. Use present tense in commit messages, e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature.”
8. Fill out all sections of the PR template.
9. Raise the PR against the `dev` branch.
10. After submitting the PR, ensure all [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) pass.

```markdown
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

> 💡 To have your pull request reviewed, you must meet the above requirements. We may ask for additional tests or changes before your pull request can be accepted.

We encourage you to contribute and help make the library better for everyone. If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out](https://bit.ly/34Vkzcg).

Thank you!
